TSMC Common Share Ex-dividend Date June 29
th
Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. — June 14, 2011 — 
TSMC (TWSE: 2330, NYSE: TSM) today announced that the
ex-dividend date for TSMC common shares shall be June 29th, 2011. The cash dividend is
NT$2.99951326 for each common share.
The above-mentioned dividend is calculated based on the dividend distribution, as approved by the
Company’s shareholder meeting on June 9th, 2011, and the actual number of common shares outstanding
on the record date for the distribution. As a result of the employee stock options exercised
between the day the Company’s board proposed said dividend distribution and the record date of the
distribution, the total number of outstanding common shares has increased slightly, resulting in a
miniscule difference in the per-share dividends from the per-share numbers proposed by the
Company’s board on February 15th, 2011.

Clarification of Media Reports
Regarding April 29 media reports on TSMC’s 2011 revenue growth target, TSMC would like to make the
following clarification to avoid any misunderstanding due to incomplete reporting by the media:
1.
 
Chairman Dr. Morris Chang clearly stated TSMC’s target of 20% revenue growth in 2011 is in
U.S. dollar terms. It is an internal goal, and not to be regarded as a financial forecast.
2.
 
Regarding media reports quoting Chairman Chang as saying “2011 is a good year”, Chairman
Chang also clearly stated that “2011 is a good year except for the exchange rate.”

TSMC Statement
Regarding the report in today’s Chinese-language Economic Daily News headlined “Shipments on Alert;
May Erode Q2 Results”, which was based on Chairman Dr. Morris Chang’s comments of March 16, TSMC
would like to make the following clarification in order to avoid any misunderstanding by investors
who may be misled by either the head-line or the report itself.
The impact of the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan on TSMC’s operations is under control.
While we do not exclude the possibility that this earthquake and its follow-on effects may impact
the global electronics supply chain, TSMC believes that the impact will be brief, as we believe
that global demand for electronics end-products remains strong. Should the demand be temporarily
suppressed due to an unstable supply chain, the market will quickly meet this pent-up demand once
the supply chain returns to normal.

USITC Begins Section 337 Investigation on TSMC
The US International Trade Commission (USITC) has initiated a Section 337 investigation on the
importation of certain semiconductor products into the US. TSMC and Samsung have been named as
respondents in the investigation. TSMC rejects the allegations of infringement by STC.UNM that led
to the investigation, and will vigorously defend against those allegations. STC.UNM has resorted to
litigation in an attempt to improperly extract a license fee.
TSMC respects the intellectual property of others, but in this case, STC.UNM’s claims are without
merit. We believe the International Trade Commission will agree when it learns all the facts.

TSMC Common Share Ex-dividend Date July 6th
Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. – June 21, 2010 — 
TSMC (TWSE: 2330, NYSE: TSM) today announced that
the ex-dividend date for TSMC common shares shall be July 6th, 2010. The cash dividend is
NT$2.99973242 for each common share.
The above-mentioned dividend is calculated based on the dividend distribution, as approved by the
Company’s shareholder meeting on June 15th, 2010, and the actual number of common shares
outstanding on the record date for the distribution. As a result of the employee stock options
exercised between the day the Company’s board proposed said dividend distribution, and the record
date of the distribution, the total number of outstanding common shares has increased slightly,
resulting in a miniscule difference in the per-share dividends from the per-share numbers proposed
by the Company’s board on February 9th, 2010.

TSMC Reports Impact From March 4 Earthquake
Initial Estimate of 1.5 Days Wafer Movement Loss
Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. 
— March 4, 2010 — TSMC (TWSE: 2330, NYSE: TSM) today announced that an
earthquake of magnitude 6.4 on the Richter scale occurred in south Taiwan at 8:18 am Taiwan local
time on March 4. The earthquake registered on instruments at TSMC’s Tainan site at magnitude 5, and
was measured at TSMC’s Hsinchu site at magnitude 2.
Current assessments reports show that the earthquake had minimal impact on Hsinchu fabs. While
Tainan fabs suffered greater impact, they have gradually begun to resume production. Our initial
estimate is that the earthquake caused the equivalent of 1.5 days loss of wafer movement for the
company in total.

TSMC Reiterates it Will Not Be Involved
In SMIC’s Operations or Join SMIC’s Board of Directors
     TSMC has repeatedly made clear to the press that speculation that TSMC will use its stake in
SMIC to intervene in SMIC’s operations or join SMIC’s Board of Directors is incorrect. However,
as some media outlets continue to issue inaccurate and highly speculative reports, TSMC General
Counsel, Dr. Dick Thurston, has the following statement:
     “Our settlement with SMIC is aimed at the protection of TSMC’s intellectual property and trade
secrets. SMIC proposed a grant of SMIC shares as part of the compensation package to TSMC under the
Settlement Agreement, and both acknowledged and agreed that TSMC would obtain those shares only if
permitted by the Taiwan government. The Settlement Agreement clearly provides that TSMC will not be
involved in SMIC’s operations, and will not be entitled to any position on SMIC’s Board of
Directors or in the manage",6.548666954040527,0.011550036225156601,UP,0.008661999264574671,UP

Statement regarding November 11 Digitimes Report
The article “TSMC to become SMIC’s largest shareholder; On the path to final acquisition” on the
front page of the November 11 issue of Digitimes’ Chinese-language print edition reported
”...According to rumor, Deputy Chairman F.C. Tzeng went to Shanghai represent TSMC in talks, and
both sides have reached an agreement allowing TSMC to become SMIC’s largest shareholder. TSMC has
confirmed this...” TSMC wishes to make clear that this is an erroneous report by the Digitimes
reporter. In fact, when this reporter contacted TSMC, we clearly stated the following:
1. TSMC and SMIC have reached a settlement of the action brought in California State Court by TSMC
against SMIC in 2006. The litigation and settlement have resulted in the full protection of TSMC’s
trade secrets in the possession of SMIC.
2. Under the new settlement agreement, the parties have agreed to a stipulated judgment in favor of

Response to November 5 Media Reports Regarding the TSMC vs. SMIC Case
Regarding media reports today that TSMC has won its case against SMIC in North America, TSMC has
the following statement:
On November 3, 2009, the jury in Alameda County Superior Court reached a verdict in TSMC’s
litigation against SMIC. The unanimous verdict confirms that SMIC breached its commitment in a
2005 settlement agreement, and misappropriated TSMC’s trade secrets. From November 5, 2009, the
jury will conduct a second phase of the trial to review the evidence of the harm TSMC has suffered
as a result of SMIC’s misappropriation and breach of the settlement agreement. Therefore, estimates
of possible compensation to be paid to TSMC in today’s media reports are speculation. TSMC will
make appropriate disclosures regarding the case once the trial is complete.

Additional detail regarding TSMC expects next year to be a record year
At TSMC’s third quarter investors’ conference on October 29, TSMC Chairman Dr. Morris Chang
commented that “For TSMC, we expect next year to be a record year.” TSMC Spokesperson and Chief
Financial Officer Ms. Lora Ho provides additional detail regarding this statement.
“Setting a record year in 2010 is TSMC’s internal target and should not be viewed as a financial
forecast,” said Ms. Ho. “What Chairman Chang has referred to as TSMC’s profit record was the net
profit set in 2006. However, he has also indicated internally that this profit goal will be
adjusted by employee profit sharing expensing, which is currently 15% of net income. Using 2006 net
income of NT$127 billion, the profit record that TSMC aims to break in 2010 will be NT$108
billion.”

TSMC Reports First Quarter EPS of NT$0.06
Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, R.O.C., April 30, 2009 — 
TSMC today announced consolidated revenue of NT$39.5
billion, net income of NT$1.56 billion, and diluted earnings per share of NT$0.06 (US$0.01 per ADS
unit) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Year-over-year, first quarter revenue decreased 54.8% while net income and diluted EPS decreased
94.5% and 94.4%, respectively. Compared to fourth quarter of 2008, first quarter results represent
a 38.8% decrease in revenue, and a decrease of 87.5% in net income and in diluted EPS. All figures
were prepared in accordance with R.O.C. GAAP on a consolidated basis.
As a result of deepening economic recession worldwide and customers’ inventory adjustment, first
quarter saw a sharp decline in the demand for semiconductors across all applications. Gross margin
for the quarter was 18.9%, operating margin was 3.1%, and net margin was 3.9%.
