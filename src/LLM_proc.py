SKELETON CODE
 - use the LLM https://medium.com/@tejasdalvi927/sentiment-analysis-using-tf-idf-and-logisticregression-5ccc4f5c4f81 as a non
 trivial solution to analyzing the contents of the articles to get a parity score
 - That particular application is made to generate a negative, positive, or neutral score based on the text (I believe it's pretrained)
 - Will add actual code soon, still making sure that I understand the function of the package correctly
