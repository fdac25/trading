            "Your greatest risk in this market isn’t what you own. It's the mental model you use to value it.\n",
            "Investors often struggle with an ingrained inability to move beyond linear thinking. They dismiss transformative technologies as bubbles because their intuition can’t grasp the fundamentals of exponential math. Exponential growth fundamentally differs from linear progress. Small, iterative doublings lead to massive scale quickly, unlike steady, incremental increases.\n",
            "Some of you may be aware of the A4 paper folding problem. A standard A4 is 1 mm thick. The first few folds are trivial, adding a few millimeters. This is the deceptive early slowness where linear forecasts tell investors to sell. But keep going: Folding the same sheet 50 times leads to thickness that exceeds the distance to the Moon. Exponential processes defy intuition through sudden, vast scale changes.\n",
            "Our cognitive bias, an exponential growth bias, is well documented. Investors fall into mental traps thinking in straight lines, which fundamentally understates the speed and magnitude of technological disruption.\n",
            "Think about Nvidia’s data center business. Revenue went from $600 million in 2017 to a staggering $41.1 billion last quarter, up 56% year-over-year. This explosive growth came from only a handful of customers while Nvidia’s AI clusters were still supply-constrained. Investors underestimated this trajectory because they were stuck in linear thinking. They saw a great chip company growing incrementally, not the foundational AI infrastructure growing exponentially. This explains how so many missed the rise of Nvidia. It also explains why those same investors are now calling AI a bubble.\n",
            "We get it. It’s comfortable to cling to legacy models built around straight-line math. Think back to the wireless revolution. Who among us during the 1990s would have correctly forecast the ubiquity of mobile devices, let alone the infrastructure needed to support them? Investors who projected phone adoption linearly missed the coming torrent of growth.\n",
            "Recognizing exponential growth phases is vital for capturing value in tech-driven sectors. Early growth can appear deceptively slow, misleading conventional forecasts. Once compounding accelerates, momentum builds rapidly, rewarding investors who saw beyond the straight line.\n",
            "While exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, understanding its dynamics helps calibrate expectations and shift investment strategies. This is not an academic exercise; it is the fundamental framework for valuing transformative innovations like AI infrastructure. Moreover, as the technology becomes cheaper and supply constraints ease, the growth engine will likely shift into overdrive.\n",
            "The message is simple: Linear thinking misses the next decade of growth. The A4 folding problem and Nvidia’s journey are not just analogies. They are the blueprints for how exponential progress blinds conventional forecasts. Your success as an investor depends on breaking free from the straight line. Align your portfolio with the acceleration..\n"

The probes are driven by fears that the immense market power and partnerships of AI leaders could stifle competition, innovation and consumer choice in this transformative technology space.\\n\\u201cTechnological advances can deliver critical innovation\\u2014but claims of innovation must not be cover for lawbreaking,\\u201d said FTC chair Lina Khan in a joint statement of regulatory bodies last year. \\u201cThere is no AI exemption to the laws on the books, and the FTC will vigorously enforce the law to combat unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition.\\u201d\\nThe Biden administration has previously accused tech giants Apple and Amazon of engaging in anticompetitive behavior and has argued that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard would lead to a monopoly in the gaming market.\\nThere is scrutiny over Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and its partnership integrating OpenAI's technology into Microsoft's products. The FTC is investigating if this deal amounted to an undisclosed acquisition that should have undergone antitrust review.\\nRegulators are wary of a few big companies controlling key elements of the AI ecosystem, including high-performance Nvidia chips, cloud computing, data for training AI models and consumer-facing applications. They aim to prevent this concentration of power.\\nThere are concerns that the AI industry is progressing rapidly without sufficient oversight or accountability mechanisms in place. Regulators want to ensure compliance with antitrust laws as the technology evolves.\\nAdditionally, AI systems can perpetuate biases present in the data they're trained on, leading to unfair outcomes in areas like job applications or loan approvals. Regulators must ensure that AI is developed and used fairly.\\nMoreover, AI systems are also vulnerable to hacking or manipulation, which could pose a grave cybersecurity threat.\\nWhile the investigations aim to promote competition, they also risk disrupting the momentum of AI innovation, if not carefully balanced. The impact will depend on the specific antitrust remedies pursued and how the AI ecosystem adapts to potential shifts in market dynamics and regulations.\\nIf the probes result in dismantling the AI firms or issuing large fines or restrictions, those consequences could hamper the tech industry\\u2019s ability to invest heavily in research and development. The immense computing power, data resources and talent pools of these tech giants have been key drivers of recent AI breakthroughs. Curbing their dominance may slow the rapid pace of AI advancement.\\nMajor tech companies have been able to attract top AI researchers and engineers with lucrative compensation and resources. Antitrust actions that diminish their market power could make it harder to acquire and retain this critical AI talent against rivals or startups.\\nInvestigations into partnerships, like Microsoft and OpenAI, could reshape the AI landscape. Collaborations that enable the sharing of models, data and expertise may be impacted, potentially fragmenting the AI ecosystem.\\nOn the positive side, curbing the dominance of a few players could open up opportunities for new AI startups and companies to emerge. Increased competition may spur innovation from different sources rather than it being concentrated among the giants.\\nAntitrust actions could limit the market power of dominant AI companies, creating a more level playing field. This could open up opportunities for startups to compete more effectively and gain market share.\\nSmaller companies might gain better access to essential resources, such as data and computing power, if antitrust measures prevent large firms from monopolizing these assets. This could lower barriers to entry and foster innovation among smaller players.\\nA more competitive market could attract venture capital and other forms of investment to AI startups, as investors seek to capitalize on new opportunities created by the breakup or regulation of larger companies.\\nThe probes signal heightened regulatory scrutiny on AI that could lead to new rules and compliance requirements. This regulatory uncertainty may make AI companies more cautious about partnerships, data practices and market behavior in the near term.\\nGiven AI's importance for national security and economic competitiveness, there are concerns that weakening U.S. tech giants could undermine the nation's AI leadership relative to China. Policymakers will need to balance antitrust objectives with strategic interests.\",\n          \"Nvidia has a market cap of roughly $550 billion compared to Apple\\u2019s nearly $2.5 trillion. We believe Nvidia can surpass Apple by capitalizing on the artificial intelligence economy, which will add an estimated $15 trillion to GDP. This is compared to the mobile economy that brought us the majority of the gains in Apple, Google and Facebook, and contributes $4.4 trillion to GDP.\\u00a0For comparison purposes, AI contributes $2 trillion to GDP as of 2018.\\nWhile mobile was primarily consumer, and some enterprise with bring-your-own-device, artificial intelligence will touch every aspect of both industry and commerce, including consumer, enterprise, and small-to-medium sized businesses, and will do so by disrupting every vertical similar to cloud. To be more specific, AI will be similar to cloud by blazing a path that is defined by lowering costs and increasing productivity.\\nI have an impeccable record on Nvidia including when I stated the sell-off in 2018 was overblown and missing the bigger picture as Nvidia has two impenetrable moats: developer adoption and the GPU-powered cloud. This was when headlines were focused exclusively on Nvidia\\u2019s gaming segment and GPU sales for crypto mining.\\nAlthough Nvidia\\u2019s stock is doing very well this year, this has been a fairly contrarian stance in the past. Not only was Nvidia wearing the dunce hat in 2018, but in August of 2019, the GPU data center revenue\\u00a0was flat to declining sequentially for three quarters, and in fiscal Q3 2020, also declined YoY (calendar Q4 2019). We established and defended our thesis on the data center as Nvidia clawed its way back in price through China tensions, supply shortages, threats of custom silicon from Big Tech, cyclical capex spending, and on whether the Arm acquisition will be approved.\\nSuffice to say, three years later and Nvidia is no longer a contrarian stock as it once was during the crypto bust. Yet, the long-term durability is still being debated \\u2014- it\\u2019s a semiconductor company after all \\u2014- best to stick with software, right? Right? Not to mention, some institutions are still holding out for Intel. Imagine being the tech analyst at those funds (if they\\u2019re still employed!).\\nBefore we review what will drive Nvidia\\u2019s revenue in the near-term, it bears repeating the thesis we published in November of 2018:\\nNvidia is already the universal platform for development, but this won\\u2019t become obvious until innovation in artificial intelligence matures. Developers are programming the future of artificial intelligence applications on Nvidia because GPUs are easier and more flexible than customized TPU chips from Google or FGPA chips used by Microsoft [from Xilinx]. Meanwhile, Intel\\u2019s CPU chips will struggle to compete as artificial intelligence applications and machine learning inferencing move to the cloud. Intel is trying to catch-up but Nvidia continues to release more powerful GPUs \\u2013 and cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google cannot risk losing the competitive advantage that comes with Nvidia\\u2019s technology.\\nThe Turing T4 GPU from Nvidia should start to show up in earnings soon, and the real-time ray-tracing RTX chips will keep gaming revenue strong when there is more adoption in 6-12 months. Nvidia is a company that has reported big earnings beats, with average upside potential of 33.35 percent to estimates in the last four quarters. Data center revenue stands at 24% and is rapidly growing. When artificial intelligence matures, you can expect data center revenue to be Nvidia\\u2019s top revenue segment. Despite the corrections we\\u2019ve seen in the technology sector, and with Nvidia stock specifically, investors who remain patient will have a sizeable return in the future.\\u201d\\nNotably, the stock is up 335% since my thesis was first published \\u2013 a notable amount for a mega cap stock and nearly 2-3X more returns than any FAAMG in the same period. This is important because I expect this to trend to continue until Nvidia has surpassed all FAAMG valuations.\\nBelow, we discuss the Ampere architecture and A100 GPUs, the Enterprise AI Suite and an update on the Arm acquisition. These are some of the near-term stepping stones that will help sustain Nvidia\\u2019s price in the coming year. We are also bullish on the Metaverse with Nvidia specifically but will leave that for a separate analysis in the coming month.\\n\\u201cNvidia\\u2019s acceleration may happen one or two years earlier as they are the core piece in the stack that is required for the computing power for the front-runners referenced in the graph above. There is a chance Nvidia reflects data center growth as soon as 2020-2021.\\u201d -published August 2019, Premium I/O Fund\\nLast year, Nvidia released the Ampere architecture and A100 GPU as an upgrade from the Volta architecture. The A100 GPUs are able to unify training and inference on a single chip, whereas in the past Nvidia\\u2019s GPUs were mainly used for training. This allows Nvidia a competitive advantage by offering both training and inferencing. The result is a 20x performance boost from a multi-instance GPU that allows many GPUs to look like one GPU. The A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over the past 8 generations.\\nAt the onset, the A100 was deployed by the world\\u2019s leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure, among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the J\\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory.\\nOne year later and the Ampere architecture is becoming one of the best-selling GPU architectures in the company\\u2019s history. This quarter, Microsoft Azure recently announced the availability of Azure ND A100 v4 Cloud GPU which is powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The company claims it to be the fastest public cloud supercomputer. The news follows the launch by Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud general availability in prior quarters. The company has been extending its leadership in supercomputing. The latest top 500 list shows that Nvidia power 342 of the world\\u2019s top 500 supercomputers, including 70 percent of all new systems and eight of the top 10. This is a remarkable update from the company.\\nAmpere architecture-powered laptop demand has also been solid as OEM\\u2019s adopted Ampere Architecture GPUs in a record number of designs. It also features the third-generation Max-Q power optimization technology enabling ultrathin designs. The Ampere architecture product cycle for gaming has also been robust, driven by RTX\\u2019s real-time ray tracing.\\nIn the area of GPU acceleration, Nvidia is\\u00a0working with Apache Spark\\u00a0to release Spark 3.0 run on\\u00a0Databricks. Apache Spark is the industry\\u2019s largest open source data analytics platform. The results are a 7x performance improvement and 90 percent cost savings in an initial test. Databricks and Google Cloud Dataproc are the first to offer Spark with GPU acceleration, which also opens up Nvidia for data analytics.\\nThe demand has been strong for the company\\u2019s products which have exceeded supply. In the earnings call, Jensen Huang mentioned \\u201cAnd so I would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment.\\u201d However, he assured that they have secured enough supplies to meet the growth plans for the second half of this year when he said, \\u201cWe expect to be able to achieve our Company's growth plans for next year.\\u201d\\nVirtualization allows companies to use software to expand the capabilities of physical servers onto a virtual system. VMWare is popular with IT departments as the platform allows companies to run many virtual machines on one server and networks can be virtualized to allow applications to function independently from hardware or to share data between computers. The storage, network and compute offered through full-scale virtual machines and Kubernetes instances for cloud-hosted applications comes with third-party support, making VMWare an unbeatable solution for enterprises.\\nTherefore, it makes sense Nvidia would choose VMWare\\u2019s VSphere as a partner on the Enterprise AI Suite, which is a cloud native suite that plugs into VMWare\\u2019s existing footprint to help scale AI applications and workloads. As pointed out by the write-up by IDC, many IT organizations struggle to support AI workloads as they do not scale as deep learning training and AI inferencing is very data hungry and requires more memory bandwidth than what standard infrastructures are capable of. CPUs are also not as efficient as GPUs, which have parallel processing. Although developers and data scientists can leverage the public cloud for the more performance demanding instances, there are latency issues with where the data repositories are stored (typically on-premise).\\nThe result is that IT organizations and developers can deploy virtual machines with accelerated AI computing where previously this was only done with bare metal servers. This allows for departments to scale and pay only for workloads that are accelerated with Nvidia capitalizing on licensing and support costs. Nvidia\\u2019s AI Enterprise targets customers who are starting out with new enterprise applications or deploying more enterprise applications and require a GPU. As enterprise customers of the Enterprise AI Suite mature and require larger training workloads, it\\u2019s likely they will upgrade to the GPU-powered cloud.\\nSubscription licenses start at $2,000 per CPU socket for one year and it includes standard business support five days a week. The software will also be supported with a perpetual license of $3,595, but support is extra. You also have the option to have get 24x7 support with additional charges. According to IDC, companies are on track to spend a combined nearly $342 billion on AI software, hardware, and services like AI Enterprise in 2021. So, the market is huge and Nvidia is expecting a significant business.\\nNvidia also announced Base Command, which is a development hub to move AI projects from prototype to production. Fleet Command is a managed edge AI software SaaS offering that allows companies to deploy AI applications from a central location with real-time processing at the edge. Companies like Everseen use these products to help retailers manage inventory and for supply chain automation.\\nOver the past year, there have been some quarters where data center revenue exceeded gaming, while in the most recent quarter, the two segments are inching closer with gaming revenue at $3.06 billion, up 85 percent year-over-year, and data center revenue at $2.37 billion, up 35 percent year-over-year.\\nIt was good timing for Jensen Huang to appear in a fully rendered kitchen for the GTC keynote as professional visualization segment was up 156% year-over-year and 40% quarter-over-quarter. Not surprisingly, automotive was down 1% sequentially although up 37% year-over-year.\\nGross margins were 64.8% when compared to 58.8% for the same period last year, which per management \\u201creflected the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition-related costs.\\u201d Adjusted gross margins were 66.7%, up 70 basis points, and net income increased 282% YoY to $2.4 billion or $0.94 per share compared to $0.25 for the same period last year.\\nAdjusted net income increased by 92% YoY to $2.6 billion or $1.04 per share compared to $0.55 for the same period last year.\\nThe company had a record cash flow from operation of $2.7 billion and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $19.7 billion and $12 billion in debt.

We also argue that the idea of Arm being neutral in a competitive industry is idealistic, and to block innovation at its most crucial point would be counterproductive for the governments reviewing the deal.

The big question we all want to know? Is Nvidia's claim that this $500 card can match or even better the RTX 2080 Ti in games - a card that currently retails for over $1500 -  really true?\\nSee my review of the RTX 3080 for more technical information on Nvidia's new graphics cards.\\n\\nI used Nvidia's 456.96 driver for the testing along with a fully up-to-date version of Windows 10. The benchmarks now include results for 1080p performance versus the RTX 2080 Ti, as the RTX 3070's price will likely mean owners of high-refresh rate monitors who game at 1080p might consider it, as well as this looking to future-proof their system. Similarly, as the RTX 3070 proved more than capable of handling games at 4K, I've compared it against several other cards both at 4K and 1440p.\\nThe test system used an MSI MEG Z490 Ace, Intel Core i9-10900K, 16GB 3466MHz Corsair memory and an Intel 760p SSD along with a custom watercooling system.\\nA comparatively easy title to tame on gaming PCs, Far Cry New Dawn saw the RTX 2080 Ti ahead but only by a few frames at 1080p and 1440p and a little more at 4K, meaning the RTX 3070 is  absolutely the card you should be buying given it's price and will devastate new and second hand prices of Nvidia's old flagship.\\nIt was a similar story in Wolfenstein: Youngblood, with the RTX 3070 posting a slightly higher average frame rate, but was a couple of frames down on the minimum 99th percentile at 1080p. At 1440p, the two were within the margin of error I'd expect to see and at 4K, the RTX 3070 edged out a small lead.\\n\\nBorderlands is slightly tougher than Wolfenstein and Far Cry, but once again the two cards are even at 1080p and within spitting distance at 1440p and 4K too.\\nWithout any ray tracing or DLSS features, the investigation showed Shadow of the Tomb Raider to prefer the RTX 2080 Ti at 1080p and 1440p, with clear leads for the older card. Even with DLSS and ray tracing enabled at 4K the RTX 2080 Ti still had a commanding lead. Still a clear win overall for the RTX 3070, though, given it costs a third of the price.\\nYet another equal fight with no clear winner, both cards were practically indistinguishable until we reached 4K where the RTX 2080 Ti drew slightly ahead. The RTX 3070, though, and Ampere and the 3000-series a clear generational leap over its predecessor here and in general though.\\nDespite matching the previous flagship in performance - a card that saw my test system draw around 403W under load, the RTX 3070 managed the same performance at just 343W. This makes it the ideal partner for small form factor systems too, where undervolting might yield far lower power draw and temperatures than the RTX 2080 Ti.\\nThe RTX 3070 is an easy recommendation for anyone with around $500 to spend on a graphics card for several reasons. It offers the same performance as the RTX 2080 Ti, at least in my benchmarks, as the RTX 2080 Ti, which while a two year-old card is still a mighty piece of silicon. However, the latter costs three times as much, which really highlights the value proposition of the RTX 3070, which holds true both with RTX features on and off.\\nSecondly, with little to no competition from AMD - yet - the RTX 3070's only other issue might have been the RTX 2080 Super, but it was significantly slower and still costs a lot more. The RTX 3070 easily kept itself cool, too, peaking at 71\\u00b0C and was supremely quiet in testing as well.\\nAs for resolutions, the RTX 3070 is primarily a 1440p card, where it managed at least 75fps on the average frame rate in all the games tested here - usually a lot more. However, it's also more than capable of handling 4K and never dipped below a minimum 99th percentile of 35fps and average of 50fps. In this sense, whether you're a casual 4K gamer or 1080p high-refresh rate obsessed, the RTX 3070 seems to have pretty much every base covered for a reasonable price tag, plus it's smaller and less power hungry than the RTX 3080 too. Want RTX 2080 Ti performance for less than $500? The RTX 3070 is for you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
