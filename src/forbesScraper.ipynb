            "Your greatest risk in this market isn’t what you own. It's the mental model you use to value it.\n",
            "Investors often struggle with an ingrained inability to move beyond linear thinking. They dismiss transformative technologies as bubbles because their intuition can’t grasp the fundamentals of exponential math. Exponential growth fundamentally differs from linear progress. Small, iterative doublings lead to massive scale quickly, unlike steady, incremental increases.\n",
            "Some of you may be aware of the A4 paper folding problem. A standard A4 is 1 mm thick. The first few folds are trivial, adding a few millimeters. This is the deceptive early slowness where linear forecasts tell investors to sell. But keep going: Folding the same sheet 50 times leads to thickness that exceeds the distance to the Moon. Exponential processes defy intuition through sudden, vast scale changes.\n",
            "Our cognitive bias, an exponential growth bias, is well documented. Investors fall into mental traps thinking in straight lines, which fundamentally understates the speed and magnitude of technological disruption.\n",
            "Think about Nvidia’s data center business. Revenue went from $600 million in 2017 to a staggering $41.1 billion last quarter, up 56% year-over-year. This explosive growth came from only a handful of customers while Nvidia’s AI clusters were still supply-constrained. Investors underestimated this trajectory because they were stuck in linear thinking. They saw a great chip company growing incrementally, not the foundational AI infrastructure growing exponentially. This explains how so many missed the rise of Nvidia. It also explains why those same investors are now calling AI a bubble.\n",
            "We get it. It’s comfortable to cling to legacy models built around straight-line math. Think back to the wireless revolution. Who among us during the 1990s would have correctly forecast the ubiquity of mobile devices, let alone the infrastructure needed to support them? Investors who projected phone adoption linearly missed the coming torrent of growth.\n",
            "Recognizing exponential growth phases is vital for capturing value in tech-driven sectors. Early growth can appear deceptively slow, misleading conventional forecasts. Once compounding accelerates, momentum builds rapidly, rewarding investors who saw beyond the straight line.\n",
            "While exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, understanding its dynamics helps calibrate expectations and shift investment strategies. This is not an academic exercise; it is the fundamental framework for valuing transformative innovations like AI infrastructure. Moreover, as the technology becomes cheaper and supply constraints ease, the growth engine will likely shift into overdrive.\n",
            "The message is simple: Linear thinking misses the next decade of growth. The A4 folding problem and Nvidia’s journey are not just analogies. They are the blueprints for how exponential progress blinds conventional forecasts. Your success as an investor depends on breaking free from the straight line. Align your portfolio with the acceleration..\n"

The cheaper RTX 5060 non-Ti version will be available next month in May and will also have 8GB of video memory.\\nNvidia\\u2019s pricing is rumored to sit at just $299 for the RTX 5060, which is the same launch price as the RTX 4060, although it remains to be seen if supply can match demand on launch and if pricing will rise higher than this given the far higher premiums we\\u2019ve seen for other RTX 50 series models such as the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090.\\nThe RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and 8GB models are rumored to have launch prices of $429 and $379 respectively. For longevity given many games make use of more than 8GB of video memory already, the 16GB model is likely to be the most sought-after.\\nUnsurprisingly, the benchmarks Nvidia has released mostly include the use of frame generation, which has divided options with consumers and reviewers. Without it in Delta Force, the RTX 5060 Ti sees a frame rate rise from around 100fps with the RTX 4060 Ti to around 130fps. Elsewhere, the fact that the RTX 50-series cards support 4x frame generation, while older cards cap out at 2x isn\\u2019t particularly clear in the graph above (which uses the maximum frame generation mode for each card), and explains why the RTX 5060 Ti is further ahead.\\nWe\\u2019ll have to wait for reviews to land for a more comprehensive view on how the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti perform and these are expected to go live no later than April 16. These will include benchmarks against various other models of graphics cards as well as at different resolutions.\\nAMD currently doesn\\u2019t have any of its new Radeon RX 9000-series models that sit at this price range, with the RX 9070 launching at $549. The Radeon RX 9060-series is expected in the near future, though, with the rumor mill already churning away on reports of RX 9060 XT 8GB and 16GB models. For now, Nvidia\\u2019s new cards will have to compete with previous generation models from both AMD\\u2019s Radeon RX 7000-series and Nvidia\\u2019s own RTX 4000-series.\\nAMD\\u2019s Radeon RX 7600 can be had for around $300 while the 7600 XT will set you back upwards of $400. Currently Nvidia\\u2019s RTX 4060 8GB costs around $330, with the RTX 4060 Ti available for less than $600 while the 16GB model rarely available for much less than $700. The release of the RTX 5060-series is likely to see prices of these older cards fall, assuming there is enough stock to prevent those annoying premiums, which is perhaps unrealistic given what\\u2019s happened following every RTX 50-series launch so far.\\nI\\u2019ll be covering news and benchmarks on the day so follow me here on Forbes using the blue button below, Facebook or YouTube to get the latest news and reviews.\",\n          \"Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang is now the 11th-richest person in the world after his net worth increased by more than $4 billion on Tuesday, scoring his highest ranking yet on Forbes\\u2019 real-time billionaire list, as the chip designer rode an artificial intelligence-driven surge to become the world\\u2019s most valuable public company.\\nHuang\\u2019s net worth increased to around $119 billion as of Tuesday afternoon as Nvidia shares traded up more than 3% to $135.70, ranking him ahead of Mukesh Ambani, India\\u2019s richest person, and behind former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.\\nHuang\\u2014who owns a 3% stake in Nvidia\\u2014started the year with a net worth of $77 billion, according to Forbes\\u2019 estimates, before the company\\u2019s market cap increased by 177% to $3.33 trillion.\\nNvidia said in a securities filing last month Huang would sell 600,000 shares of the company through March 2025, which would net him just over $81.4 million at the company\\u2019s current share price.\\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\\u2019s headlines.

That\\u2019s how much Huang\\u2019s net worth has increased since 2019, when Forbes estimated him to be the 546th-richest person in the world. Huang was worth $21 billion last year, ranking him as the world\\u2019s 76th-richest person.\\nHuang has served as Nvidia\\u2019s chief executive and president since cofounding the company in 1993. Nvidia went public in 1999 and has surged in trading in recent years as it dominates the market for the chips needed to power artificial intelligence software, most recently surpassing the market cap of Microsoft and Apple. The company recently executed a stock split\\u2014when a company increases the number of shares without diluting the stock\\u2019s value\\u2014that cut Nvidia\\u2019s share price below $130 after trading above $1,200.\",\n          \"U.S. export policy around advanced semiconductors \\u2014 particularly Nvidia\\u2019s H20 and Blackwell-class AI chips \\u2014 has created a growing debate about how to balance national security and economic competitiveness. None of this is new to me, as I dealt with export controls during my time at AMD and have written about earlier export restrictions placed on Nvidia by the U.S. Department of Commerce\\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. (Note that Nvidia is an advisory client of my firm, Moor Insights & Strategy.)\\nIn short, I support allowing Nvidia to sell the H20 and future de-tuned Blackwell variants directly to China for non-military use. Further, I support allowing full-featured Blackwells to be exported for datacenters in the Middle East owned by non-Chinese cloud service providers, starting with AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle, as well as vendors of on-prem equipment like Dell Technologies, Cisco, HPE and Lenovo when outfitting smaller CSPs. This infrastructure should be eligible for use even by Chinese civilian customers. All of this should be carried out under strict know-your-customer protocols.\\nI believe this position balances the need to limit military AI proliferation by China while avoiding self-defeating protectionism that erodes American market leadership and accelerates Chinese alternatives. I\\u2019ve publicly said that it\\u2019s better to sell chips with strict controls than to sit back and watch Huawei take market share. History shows Huawei\\u2019s ability to become a juggernaut across different areas of tech \\u2014 witness its 30% share of the global market for carrier networking equipment. If we continue down the path of maximum restriction, we risk enabling Huawei to build its own AI \\u201cBelt and Road\\u201d in Asia and beyond. By contrast, letting Nvidia compete under reasonable safeguards would ensure that American standards \\u2014 not Chinese ones \\u2014 define the next wave of global AI.\\nThe Biden Administration imposed sweeping restrictions on AI chip exports to China through regulatory frameworks such as the October 7, 2022 Commerce Department rule and the follow-up interim final rule of October 17, 2023. The Biden Administration added worldwide controls in the January 2025 framework known as the \\u201cAI Diffusion Rule.\\u201d These rules defined performance thresholds that covered products such as Nvidia\\u2019s A100, launched in 2020, and were intended to limit proliferation of frontier AI hardware. Nvidia\\u2019s H100, H200 and other advanced GPUs were blocked, but the H20 was designed to comply with the new rules with plenty of room to spare \\u2014 falling well within the thresholds of the BIS \\u201cgreen zone\\u201d and thus not requiring a license or notice before shipping. While critics argue that this is a loophole, the rules were designed to encourage sales of green-zone products like the H20. In December 2023, Biden\\u2019s Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, stated that Nvidia \\u201ccan, will and should sell AI chips\\u201d such as the H20 \\u2014 while reserving the highest-performing products for the U.S. and its allies.\\nAfter a slow start, H20 sales gradually picked up, because the product is a workhorse for workloads such as recommender systems, consumer internet and chatbots. Earlier this year, however, the Trump Administration froze further sales of the H20 through a process called an \\u201cis informed\\u201d letter \\u2014 not a regulation \\u2014 instructing Nvidia to halt until further notice.\\nIn the wake of the U.S.\\u2013China trade and export negotiations of the past few months, the Trump Administration has indicated that H20 sales can resume, subject to notice and license requirements. The new policy is still much more strict than the Biden Administration\\u2019s \\u2014 which allowed sales without any notice \\u2014 but it will allow Nvidia to compete on the ground with China\\u2019s national champion, Huawei.\\nSome China trade hawks argue against allowing H20 sales to China or enabling CSPs or other vendors to serve Chinese clients with cutting-edge AI compute in the cloud. The claim is that China may obtain enough H20s to support the development of multiple AI superclusters. Other arguments hold that the current export framework is too flimsy, making enforcement difficult, or suggesting that it\\u2019s bad (i.e., low-margin) business for Nvidia while simultaneously strengthening Huawei\\u2019s domestic alternatives.\\nBut the concern that U.S.-designed chips may end up supporting Chinese military ambitions overlooks China\\u2019s own immense stockpile of AI chips (such as the Huawei Ascend) and the control mechanisms already available through cloud service providers or even the vendors for non-cloud superclusters required to create a leading-edge AGI frontier model. Because they are low-powered enough to operate in the BIS \\u201cgreen zone,\\u201d H20s are already available to CSPs in China \\u2014 as they should be to keep those Chinese companies happily using U.S. technology. Meanwhile, civilian use of more advanced GPUs is both separable and traceable when routed through CSPs or vendors for on-premises or private-cloud infrastructure or smaller CSPs \\u2014 based in the U.S. or allied nations \\u2014 that operate under strict KYC requirements. For example, these protocols already enable U.S. cloud infrastructure providers to serve Chinese customers from U.S.-based datacenters, making the same approach feasible for deployments in the Middle East or elsewhere. Other mechanisms, such as U.S.-provided and -approved operating system software, or U.S.-provided service and support, can provide reasonable assurances as well.\\nFurther, claims about weak enforcement fail to acknowledge the physical and operational security present in the Gulf region. Data campuses in places like the UAE \\u2014 such as the planned 5-gigawatt AI campus \\u2014 are hardened, auditable, and have well-developed telemetry systems that enable real-time visibility into GPU workloads. This makes diversion significantly harder than assumed. Five years ago, the fungible matter in question was a card; now it is a complete rack in Nvidia\\u2019s new B300 world.\\nAs for the \\u201cbad business for Nvidia\\u201d part, it\\u2019s important to recognize that even low-margin volume helps sustain Nvidia\\u2019s manufacturing scale, and finances the R&D pipeline that drives U.S. leadership in AI. I also believe the newest Blackwell derivative for the China market will have a better cost basis due to its memory architecture. Starving U.S. companies \\u2014 and not just Nvidia \\u2014 of addressable markets only weakens the broader national-security and economic foundations they support. And every yuan of AI spending that goes to Nvidia is a yuan that doesn\\u2019t go to Huawei to reinvest into R&D, create better AGI sooner and spread it around the world \\u2014 as it successfully did with its equipment for the telecom market.\\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are key players in proposed GPU deployments, have no incentive to smuggle chips \\u2014 they are resource-rich nations focused on energy exports, not illicit trade in AI hardware. Moreover, U.S.-based operators such as Microsoft and Amazon, even when deploying infrastructure abroad, still fall under U.S. export enforcement jurisdictions. The logistical difficulty of smuggling datacenter-grade hardware is often underestimated; these GPUs arrive preassembled into racks that can weigh over 3,600 pounds, making physical diversion highly impractical.\\nDavid Sacks, the Trump Administration\\u2019s AI and crypto czar, made some good points when he said on his All-In podcast, \\u201cJust look at market share. If we have like 80 to 90% market share, that\\u2019s winning. . . . If (China) has 80% market share, then we\\u2019re in big trouble.\\u201d\\nThis framework can ensure that Chinese customers that access compute through Middle Eastern CSPs do so for civilian purposes only: e-commerce, LLM inference, logistics and so on. With military or frontier model training barred effectively, such usage does not create a meaningful national security threat, in my opinion.\\nOne major consideration is the potential for Huawei to dominate AI infrastructure across the Belt and Road Initiative countries if the U.S. restricts Nvidia\\u2019s ability to compete. The Ascend AI stack \\u2014 Huawei\\u2019s response to Nvidia\\u2019s CUDA stack \\u2014 is maturing rapidly. Blocking U.S. exports will unintentionally provide Huawei with captive market share in the Gulf region and South America, thereby accelerating its learning curve and scale.\\nSecond, diffusion of American AI hardware, software, and frameworks is how the U.S. has historically maintained technological supremacy. Broad adoption of U.S. technology such as CUDA makes it difficult for alternative ecosystems to take hold. In that sense, the CUDA software stack is not just a performance accelerator \\u2014 it\\u2019s a strategic lever. Widespread diffusion of Nvidia\\u2019s technology means technology lock-in that benefits U.S. interests.\\nAnother underappreciated factor is mutual dependency. While the U.S. continues to rely on Chinese rare earths and materials, China remains reliant on Nvidia\\u2019s hardware and software stack. Chinese enterprises overwhelmingly prefer U.S. chips over domestic alternatives, when they can get them, due to performance and software maturity. Accelerating the decoupling of supply chains by denying access to Nvidia exports may ultimately backfire by pushing China toward full self-sufficiency.\\nRather than blanket bans, U.S. policy makers should implement targeted measures that mitigate risk without ceding strategic advantage. H20 sales to China should resume, subject to the licensing regime the Trump Administration has adopted. Blackwell GPU exports should be permitted to CSPs from the U.S. or allied nations operating facilities in the Middle East that serve Chinese civilian clients under rigorous KYC mechanisms \\u2014 or with other safeguards acceptable to BIS, which can enable safe and secure on-prem and private cloud deployments as well. Large systems of concern can maintain detailed telemetry, usage logs and auditable records accessible to U.S. regulators.\\nExport licenses should clearly define prohibited end uses, including military and sensitive non-military applications, along with intelligence-related activities. More generally, national security should be redefined to include market share as a metric \\u2014 because if the U.S. controls the global AI stack, it inherently retains strategic leverage.\\nFinally, the United States should collaborate with allies to formalize a global KYC enforcement regime for AI, harmonizing standards to prevent backdoor access and creating collective strength in export compliance.\\nU.S. leadership in semiconductors and AI has always been driven by innovation and market scale. Choking off the global market \\u2014 particularly in regions aligned with U.S. interests \\u2014 only serves to isolate Nvidia (and other American companies) and subsidize Huawei. China\\u2019s AI ambitions will continue regardless of U.S. policy. The question is: will they use American technology, or their own? By selling Nvidia solutions to China, can the U.S. get to AGI first? It seems to me that the U.S. government would want that.\\nWith CSP-mediated controls, telemetry audits, and export compliance frameworks, I believe we can thread the needle \\u2014 preventing diversion of cutting-edge AI technology while retaining global relevance. Blocking H20 from China or blocking Blackwell from even CSP-mediated delivery into China-aligned regions would be a strategic mistake.\\nWe should lead by selling, not retreating.\\nMoor Insights & Strategy provides or has provided paid services to technology companies, like all tech industry research and analyst firms.
